Build the image as would any other form a dock file.
After the image is built, from this directory issue the folowing 
syntax to copy the ssh_config and sshd_config files to the containers
etc/ssh folder


docker cp [OPTIONS] SRC_PATH|- CONTAINER:DEST_PATH

example:

docker cp ssh_cfg my_container:/etc/ssh

Once that is completed commit the image

docker commit my_container myimage/name

Use myimage/name in you config.json files
